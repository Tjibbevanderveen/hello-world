# hello-world
My first repository, just for trying how to work with GitHub
Hello, my name is Tjibbe van der Veen. 45 years old, married and a father of three.
I am a teacher/lecturer at Stenden University, a school in the north of the Netherlands with branches in Leeuwarden, Groningen, Meppel and Emmen. It is in Emmen that I teach at our School of Business in the Business Economics department.
Currently I'm doing research and trying to write my thesis for a Master in Service Management.
